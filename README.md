## Build

Requires CMake 3.21 and a C++20 compiler. Use the included `sh` scripts on Linux and the `ps1` scripts on Windows. First download [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg):

```
./misc/get_vcpkg.sh
```

Regular build:

```
./misc/build.sh
```

Linux / Mac only:

Build with [address sanitizer](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer):

```
./misc/asan_build.sh
```

Build with [thread sanitizer](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerCppManual):

```
./misc/tsan_build.sh
```

## Limitations

Multiblend requires SSE4.1 at the moment, so it won't build on e.g. Mac M1+. This can be fixed by integrating the [simde](https://github.com/simd-everywhere/simde) library.

## Library integration

Check out [Xpano](https://github.com/krupkat/xpano) for an example of integrating the Multiblend library in your C++ project.
